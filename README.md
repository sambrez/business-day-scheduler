# business-day-scheduler

## Description

This repository contains code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website that provides users with an interactive scheduler where they can add and save events by hour for a 9-5 work day. It includes a block for every hour with editable text areas for event and note additions. These additions can be saved so that they persist on the page. Furthermore, hour blocks are color coded as either past, present, or future in comparison to the current hour. This repo also utilizes the JQuery library as is evident in the js file. I found loops in JQuery to be exceptionally challenging in this project but after discovering the .each() function I was able to work through my original issues. I enjoyed the added practice that this project provided on working with the 'this' object reference.

## Credits

I utilized JQuery API documentation while building this project. Specifically, I heavily referenced the documentation on traversing while coding the click events as well as documentation on attributes. I would like to acknowledge the help I received from AskBSC learning assistants, Dean and Rudie. Dean helped with addressing minor issues related to the coded click events failing to store values in local storage. Rudie helped with issues involving the conditional statements, specifically with comparing different data types and the sequence of if/else statements. Thier guidance was essential in helping me to discovering how to evaluate and resolve issues.
